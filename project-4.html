              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                I did this project together with my friend and classmate Ellinor Bergfeldt. I wanted to use our assignment to practice level design, specifically with having a clear location in mind, which I learned from my previous project is very important. 
                We decided to use a graveyard as our setting. Due to the open nature of cemeteries which does not blend well with cover based FPS games, this was a challenge I gladly accepted.
              </p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                Before breaking down the level design process, I will quickly describe the mechanics of the game. <br><br>

                Ellinor set up the game to work with networks, meaning we did not need to make a local multiplayer version made for controllers. <br><br>

                The game mode is "Kill Confirmed - Free for All", based on the Call of Duty game modes.<br><br>

                The players have unlimited primary ammo, but with limited secondary ammo. Secondary ammo is used for "utility shots", such as creating explosions that push players back or stun them upon impact. This ammo recharges, and if fully expended 
                the entire weapon will overload, preventing it from being fired at all for a short time. <br><br>

                The players do not have crosshairs. This is due to the offset created by using the gun as the starting point for the projectile rather than the camera. We planned on implementing a laser sight that would be visible to all players and could be toggled on or off, 
                to give the player a choice between stealth and accuracy. <br><br>

                While Ellinor was the main (and trained) programmer, I made some blueprints to prototype mechanics such as health packs. Integrating functions into the network was a step beyond my abilites, but I managed to create locally functional mechanics that clearly communicated my ideas 
                to Ellinor so she could then create a polished and network integrated version of them. I also modified her existing blueprints to create variations for utility shots.
              </p>
              <h3 class="project-details__content-title">Level Design Choices</h3>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                With the setting decided, me and Ellinor visited local cemetaries for inspiration. To see how it might be arranged and look for objects that could be used for cover or concealment. 
                <img
              src="./assets/jpeg/gyCollage.jpg"
              alt="Project Image"
              class="project-details__showcase-img"
            />
                With these photos we took in mind, I figured that the level could feature a lot of gravestones (shocking), trees, bushes and statues. I also wanted to include crypts, since they are a common building in graveyards and could provide a lot of level design utility. 
                They are also quite mysterious in my opinion, and somewhat creepy. <br><br>

                Other than actual graveyards, I used <u><a href="https://callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/Wasteland">Wastland</a></u> from the 2009 version of <u><a href="https://callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/Call_of_Duty:_Modern_Warfare_2">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</a></u> as 
                inspiration. Wasteland is a very open map, which this graveyard map would also be. Most of all, the map gave me courage to go through with making such an open FPS level. I realized that Wasteland uses verticality in the form of smaller hills and trenches to create 
                most cover and concealment. The map also has the central bushes that act as walls, cutting the map in half.  <br><br>

                While exploring the cemetaries, it also struck me that it's important to convey the spookines of the place. This developed into the idea of jumping down into open graves, or following stairs in the cathedral or crypts down into secret underground tunnels. 
                My visual inspiration for how I imagined this space to look was inspired by the catacombs underneath Paris, and the caverns where Army of the Dead in Lord of the Rings were found. <br><br>

                The idea of adding catacombs or secret tunnel meant I would now be designing two levels that were connected but would function differently. This new space also allowed to me create a space more conventionally suited for FPS games. I sketched 
                basic layout ideas for both, with indications of where they would connect. Most connections would be one way, this is because most of them would need the player to jump down into a grave to enter the catacombs. This little detail is something I found 
                fitting, since it is narratively creepy, and gameplay wise it also a risk since the player doesn't know if another player could be lurking down there as they jump plunge into the dark space underneath. The two connections are stairs from the crypts and the cathedral.

                src="./assets/jpeg/gySkissOW.jpg"

              />

              />
              Catacombs sketch shown above. <br><br>

              These sketches gave me a valuable way of roughly planning out the macro space and how it would all be connected. During development I strayed from these sketches, mainly in the catacombs, because I would find out that some spaces would make more sense or play better 
              if arranged differently.
