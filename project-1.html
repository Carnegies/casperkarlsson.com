                Finding your place as a game designer for a visual novel can be difficult. In our group we discussed what could be done to increase interacitivty in the game and eventually came to a cool solution. 
                The visual novel would have mini games that directly impact the story. They would emulate a part of the story and the outcome of the mini game would be reflected in the branching narrative. 
                As a lone game designer on the project, I now had my work cut out for me. 
              </p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                There were several challenges with this task;<br>
                Concepting, prototyping, testing and implementing <strong>multiple</strong> mini games<br>
                Surprising the player<br>
                Without demanding too many art assets<br>
                Without demanding too much work for programmers<br>
                Weaving every mini game into the story, in a way where different outcomes can reasonably be portrayed in the narrative<br>
              </p>
              <h3 class="project-details__content-title">Rapid Prototyping</h3>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                 Within a few weeks I developed six different mini games, three of which there was room for in the final project.<br><br>
                 The prototypes needed to be tested and interated on very quickly, since we in this project had only a couple of weeks for the entire project. Of course our musician, artists, sound designer and our programmers needed time to be able to produce the assets the mini game expected of them. Not to mention that the story in which the mini game would be included first had to be written by our writers. I had no time waste.<br>
                 I used different tools for the prototypes. Most of them were made in <strong>GameMaker Studio</strong>, but one also used <strong>Twine</strong> and mainly <strong>paper and pen</strong>.<br><br>
                 I prefered making prototypes to <strong>better communicate</strong> my ideas. A design document can be an effective tool, but leaves more things open to interpretation. A prototype can better <strong>show</strong> an idea and makes it easier to discuss since it puts mechanics, world settings and much more into practical context.
                 My team agreed with me. No one in the group wanted to read through design documents and would rather get their hands on a prototype to see what how things work, where sound could be implemented and how art could be made to fit.

                 The stealth mini game was supposed to fit in with the story of the game's influencer character. Fans would be looking for the famous influencer and you would try to sneak past them. 
                 Since we wanted to potential endings of the story depending on the dialogue options chosen by the player, there were two modes; <br>
                 good guy mode, where you simply try to avoid everyone with some of the actively looking for you <br>
                 and bad guy mode; where you hunt the ones not actively looking for you.<br><br>
                 The above video shows the prototype I made in GameMaker. Due to technical issues, the Unity version could not be used in the final product. In this version, I did the design, programming and VFX. Sounds, music and art assets were made by my groupmates.

                Platformer gameplay starts at 0:50, with some narrative context before that.<br><br>
                This is the Platformer mini game that replaced the Stealth mini game. It was meant to fit in with the story of an unfinished character. The idea was that the player character was in an arcade hall, playing this game. The same game would be played twice, but the second time 
                the player character would try to impress the person they were talking to and "hack themselves into the game" and start eating the NPCs in the arcade game.<br><br>
                When the Stealth game had to be scrapped only a couple of weeks before our deadline, we decided that this mini game would replace it. Due to limited time, I was tasked with the Unity implementation and programming of the final version of the mini game. <br><br>

                Design wise, I decided to use the wall jump to create action. Simply jumping from platform to platform can feel static, so having to fight gravity as a kind of timer made the game more interesting. Of course, the level needs to properly paced. Therefore I 
                placed some rest areas with checkpoints to break up pace when I saw fit. The closer to the end they got, the more time the player would spend in the air, with increased durations of action. This was used to create a sense of progression and create a 
                "boss stage" at the end of the level. The main way I managed to force the use of walljumping was through placing spikes upon surfaces that the player would otherwise land on, causing players to jump over and around walls. <br><br>
                
                I was happy with the results. The level was difficult, which surprised players. The mini game gained local noteriety for its difficulty, and people would gather their friends to face off against each other and see who could get the fastest time. 
                In retrospect however, I would make the level easier by adding branching paths that would reward the player proportinally to their difficulty. 

                <br><br>
              
                In the above video, the Unity version is shown, and below, my GameMaker prototype is shown. In Unity I designed the mini game and programmed it. In the GameMaker version I made everything.
